<!-- Read this before creating packages: https://github.com/chocolatey/chocolatey/wiki/CreatePackages -->

<!--
This is a nuspec. It mostly adheres to https://docs.nuget.org/create/Nuspec-Reference. Chocolatey uses a special version of NuGet.Core that allows us to do more than was initially possible. As such there are certain things to be aware of:

* the package xmlns schema url may cause issues with nuget.exe
* Any of the following elements can ONLY be used by choco tools - projectSourceUrl, docsUrl, mailingListUrl, bugTrackerUrl, packageSourceUrl, provides, conflicts, replaces 
* nuget.exe can still install packages with those elements but they are ignored. Any authoring tools or commands will error on those elements 
-->
<!-- You can embed software files directly into packages, as long as you are not bound by distribution rights. -->
<!-- * If you are an organization making private packages, you probably have no issues here -->
<!-- * If you are releasing to the community feed, you need to consider distribution rights. -->
<!-- Do not remove this test for UTF-8: if “Ω” doesn’t appear as greek uppercase omega letter enclosed in quotation marks, you should use an editor that supports UTF-8, not this one. -->

=====================================================

[![Build status](https://travis-ci.org/FStarLang/FStar.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/FStarLang/FStar)

## Notice
This package will install F* language with compatable version of z3.  
It is recommended that you remove your z3 package and then install F*

### F\* website

More information on F\* can be found at www.fstar-lang.org

### Installation

See [INSTALL.md](https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/blob/master/INSTALL.md)

### Tutorial

The [F\* tutorial](https://www.fstar-lang.org/tutorial/) provides a first taste of verified programming in
F\*, explaining things by example.

### Wiki

The [F\* wiki](https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/wiki) contains additional, usually more in-depth, technical
documentation on F\*.

### Editing F* code

You can edit F\* code using your favourite text editor, but Emacs,
Atom, and Vim have extensions that add special support for F\*,
including syntax highlighting and interactive development. More
details on [editor support](https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/wiki/Editor-support-for-F*) on the [F\* wiki](https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/wiki) .

### Executing F* code

By default F* only verifies the input code, it does not compile or execute it.
To execute F* code one needs to translate it to either OCaml or F\#, using
F\*'s code extraction facility---this is invoked using the command line
argument `--codegen OCaml` or `--codegen FSharp`. More details on
[executing F\* code](https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/wiki/Executing-F*-code) on the [F\* wiki](https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/wiki) .

### Community mailing list

The [fstar-club mailing list](http://lists.gforge.inria.fr/mailman/listinfo/fstar-club) is dedicated to F* users. Here is where
all F* announcements are made to the general public (e.g. for
releases, new papers, etc) and where users can ask questions, ask for
help, discuss, provide feedback, announce jobs requiring at least 10
years of F* experience, etc.

[List archives](https://lists.gforge.inria.fr/pipermail/fstar-club/) are public, but only members can post.
[Join here](http://lists.gforge.inria.fr/mailman/listinfo/fstar-club)!


### Slack channel

Users can also ask questions on the `#fstar` Slack channel at
&lt; http://fpchat.com/ &gt;

### Reporting issues

Please report issues using the [F\* issue tracker](https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/issues) on GitHub.
Before filing please use search to make sure the issue doesn't already exist.
We don't maintain old releases, so if possible please use the
[online F\* editor](https://www.fstar-lang.org/run.php) or directly [the GitHub sources](https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/blob/master/INSTALL.md#building-f-from-source) to check
that your problem still exists on the `master` branch.


### Blog

The [F\* for the masses](https://fstarlang.github.io/) blog is also expected to become an important
source of information and news on the F\* project.


### License

This new variant of F* is released under the [Apache 2.0 license](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0);
see `LICENSE` for more details.

    <releaseNotes>A large number of people contributed to this release: thanks to all!

Here are a few highlights:

# Main new features

- Meta-F*: A metaprogramming and tactic framework, as described in this [report](https://arxiv.org/abs/1803.06547). Code samples are in examples/tactics, examples/native_tactics and the `FStar.Tactics` and `FStar.Reflection` libraries. Many people contributed a lot to this work, especially Guido Martinez.

- Improved type inference with two-phase typechecking: We now build verification conditions for a program after a first phase of type inference. This improves inference of implicit arguments and reduces our trust in the type inference. Thanks to Aseem Rastogi!

- Caching typechecked modules: F* emits ".checked" files, an on-disk representation of a typechecked module that can be read back later. This significantly reduces the time to load a module's dependences.

# Many other improvements

A sampling of improvements across the entire tool chain:

- Resolving several syntactic ambiguities in the parser

- A correct pretty printer for surface terms, using `fstar --indent`

- A new dependence analysis to support incremental compilation for larger projects

- Overhauling the higher order unification algorithm, both in the representation of meta-variables and in the handling of unfolding, leading to significant performance and robustness improvements (see https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/wiki/Design-note:-Revising-the-unifier)

- Automatic generation of interfaces for modules and tighter enforcement of abstraction boundaries (see https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/wiki/Revised-checking-of-a-module's-interface)

- Improvements to the SMT encoding, removing axioms that lead to performance problems and reducing brittleness related to optimizations in the encoding, notably shallow vs deep encodings 

- Improved type-based erasure for extraction

- Several new and improved libraries, including a revised treatment of footprints for Low* programs, in `FStar.Modifies`

- And work by many people in Project Everest whose use of F* drove a lot of the work in this release.

- Plus many other improvements and changes as described in https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/blob/v0.9.6.0/CHANGES.md

- And [180 closed github issues](https://github.com/FStarLang/FStar/issues?utf8=%E2%9C%93&amp;q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed+closed%3A%222017-08-23+..+2018-05-17%22+)</releaseNotes>
